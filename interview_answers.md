# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

State components contain the state object and event handling functions whereas functional components do not have state.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

componentWillMount is called before the component mounts and componentWillUpdate is called before a component is updated or when state is changed.

3. Define stateful logic.

Stateful logic is code that deals with the state in a component, such as  event handlers.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?

Arrange: render the component to be tested

Act: query the DOM for specific node(s) to be tested

Assert: assert that node(s) has/have been rendered successfully.
